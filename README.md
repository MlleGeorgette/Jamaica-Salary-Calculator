# Jamaica-Salary-Calculator
A few years ago, I created a spreadsheet to calculate estimated take-home pay for advertised salaries. Of course, in Jamaica, it's not common to see salary figures in job ads but the spreadsheet made it easier when I did see it - I could quickly work out what my net income would be and whether it's worth applying to the job.

Now that I've seen the light with code, I figured it would be even easier if I converted my spreadsheet into an app! As a newbie to coding, this was a fun task because I got to do something meaningful while learning a bit more about Python and PyWebio.
